# - Appears in application menus and search results
# - Desktop shortcut for quick access
# - Proper icon and metadata for professional appearance
# - Follows freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification
# - Works with all Linux desktop environments
#
# ICON HIERARCHY:

# 2. ElyPrismLauncher instance icon (fallback)
# 3. System generic icon (ultimate fallback)
#
# DESKTOP FILE LOCATIONS:
# - Desktop shortcut: ~/Desktop/MinecraftSplitscreen.desktop
# - System integration: ~/.local/share/applications/MinecraftSplitscreen.desktop
#
# @global      ACTIVE_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT - (input) Path to the launcher script
