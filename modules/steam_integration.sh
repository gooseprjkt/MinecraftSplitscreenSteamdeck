# @description
#   Handles the integration of Minecraft Splitscreen launcher with Steam,
#   providing native Steam library integration, Big Picture mode support,
#   and Steam Deck Game Mode integration.
#
#   Key features:
#   - Automatic Steam shortcut creation via shortcuts.vdf modification
#   - SteamGridDB artwork download for professional appearance
#   - Duplicate shortcut detection and prevention
#   - Safe Steam shutdown/restart procedure
#   - Steam Deck-aware process management
#
# @dependencies
#   - utilities.sh (for print_header, print_success, print_warning, print_error, print_info, print_progress)
#   - path_configuration.sh (for ACTIVE_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT, ACTIVE_DATA_DIR, ACTIVE_LAUNCHER)
#   - curl (for downloading Steam integration script)
#   - python3 (for running add-to-steam.py)
#
# @exports
#   Functions:
#     - setup_steam_integration : Main function to add launcher to Steam
#
# @changelog
#   2.0.1 (2026-01-26) - Refactored to use centralized prompt_yes_no function
#   2.0.0 (2026-01-25) - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

# @function    setup_steam_integration
# @description Add Minecraft Splitscreen launcher to Steam library.
#              Handles Steam shutdown, shortcut creation via Python script,
#              artwork download from SteamGridDB, and Steam restart.
#
# STEAM INTEGRATION BENEFITS:
# - Launch directly from Steam's game library interface
# - Access from Steam Big Picture mode (ideal for Steam Deck)
# - Controller support through Steam Input system
# - Game Mode integration on Steam Deck
# - Professional appearance with custom artwork
# - Consistent with other Steam games in library
#
# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
# 1. Detects active Steam installation and user data
# 2. Safely shuts down Steam to modify shortcuts database
# 3. Creates backup of existing shortcuts for safety
# 4. Uses specialized Python script to modify binary shortcuts.vdf format
# 5. Downloads custom artwork from SteamGridDB for professional appearance
# 6. Restarts Steam with new shortcut available
#
# SAFETY MEASURES:
# - Checks for existing shortcut to prevent duplicates
# - Creates backup before modifications
# - Uses official Steam binary format handling
# - Handles multiple Steam installation types (native, Flatpak)
#
# @global      ACTIVE_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT - (input) Path to the launcher script

# @stdin       User confirmation from /dev/tty (for curl | bash compatibility)
# @return      0 on success or skip, 1 if ACTIVE_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT not set
