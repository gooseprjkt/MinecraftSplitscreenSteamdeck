## Dynamic Splitscreen Mode (v3.0.0)

Version 3.0.0 introduces **Dynamic Splitscreen** - players can now join and leave mid-session without everyone needing to start at the same time.

### How It Works

1. **Launch the game** - Choose "Dynamic" mode when prompted (or press 2)
2. **Start playing** - The first controller detected launches Player 1 in fullscreen
3. **Players join** - When a new controller connects, a new Minecraft instance launches and all windows reposition automatically
4. **Players leave** - When a player quits Minecraft, remaining windows expand to use the available space
5. **Session ends** - When all players have exited, the launcher closes

### Window Repositioning

The system automatically repositions windows based on player count:
- **1 player**: Fullscreen
- **2 players**: Top/Bottom split
- **3-4 players**: Quad split (2x2 grid)

**Desktop Mode (X11)**: Uses `xdotool` or `wmctrl` for smooth, non-disruptive window repositioning.

**Steam Deck Game Mode**: Restarts instances with new positions (the splitscreen mod only reads configuration at startup).

### Optional Packages (Recommended but Not Required)

**Dynamic mode works without any extra packages!** However, for the best experience:

| Package | Benefit | Without It |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `inotify-tools` | Instant controller detection | 2-second polling delay |
| `xdotool`/`wmctrl` | Smooth window repositioning | Brief restart when layout changes |
| `libnotify` | Desktop notifications | Silent operation |

The installer detects available tools and shows you what's enabled at the end of installation.

## Installation
1. **Quick Install (Recommended):**
   
   Run this single command to download and execute the installer:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooseprjkt/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh | bash
   ```
   
   **Alternative method** (download first, then run):
   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooseprjkt/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   chmod +x install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ./install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh
   ```
   
   **Note:** The installer will automatically detect which Java version you need based on your selected Minecraft version and install it if not present. No manual Java setup required!
   
   **Note:** If you already have ElyPrismLauncher installed (via Flatpak or AppImage), the installer will detect and use your existing installation.

2. **Install Python 3 (optional)**
   - Only required if you want to add the launcher to Steam automatically
   - Most Linux distributions include Python 3 by default
   - For Arch: `sudo pacman -S python`
   - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3`

3. **Follow the prompts** to customize your installation:
   - **Java installation:** The installer will automatically:
     - Detect the required Java version for your chosen Minecraft version (Java 8, 16, 17, or 21)
     - Search for existing Java installations on your system
     - Download and install the correct Java version automatically if not found (using [install-jdk-on-steam-deck](https://github.com/FlyingEwok/install-jdk-on-steam-deck))
     - Configure environment variables and validate the installation
   - **Minecraft version:** Choose your preferred version from a curated list of versions that are fully compatible with both required splitscreen mods (Controllable and Splitscreen Support), or press Enter for the latest compatible version
   - **Mod selection process:** The installer will automatically:
     - Search for compatible Fabric versions of all supported mods
     - Filter out incompatible versions using Modrinth and CurseForge APIs
     - Automatically resolve and download all mod dependencies using live API calls
     - Download dependency mods (like Fabric API for most mods) without manual specification
     - Handle mod conflicts and suggest alternatives when needed
     - Show progress for each mod download with success/failure status
     - Report any missing mods at the end if compatible versions aren't found
   - **Steam integration (optional):** 
     - Choose "y" to add a shortcut to Steam for easy access from Game Mode on Steam Deck
     - Choose "n" if you prefer to launch manually or don't use Steam
   - **Desktop launcher (optional):**
     - Choose "y" to create a desktop shortcut and add to your applications menu
     - Choose "n" if you only want to launch from Steam or manually
   - **Installation progress:** The installer will show detailed progress including:
     - ElyPrismLauncher download and CLI verification
     - Instance creation (4 separate Minecraft instances for splitscreen)
     - Launcher script generation
     - Automatic Java version detection and installation (if needed)
     - Mod downloads with Fabric compatibility verification
     - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

5. **Steam Deck only - Optional: Install Steam Deck controller auto-disable:**

   The launcher script now automatically handles Steam Deck controller detection in most cases. However, if you want to use the Steam Deck's built-in controls AND external controllers simultaneously (e.g., Steam Deck as P1, external controller as P2), you may need this tool:
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller/main/curl_install.sh | bash
   ```
   See [Steam Deck Controller Handling](#steam-deck-controller-handling) for details on automatic controller detection.

## Technical Details
- **Mod Compatibility:** Uses both Modrinth and CurseForge APIs with Fabric filtering (`modLoaderType=4` for CurseForge, `.loaders[] == "fabric"` for Modrinth)
- **Instance Management:** Dynamic verification and registration of created instances
- **Error Recovery:** Enhanced error handling with automatic fallbacks and manual creation options
- **Memory Optimization:** Configured for splitscreen performance (3GB max, 512MB min per instance)

## Steam Deck Controller Handling

The launcher script includes intelligent controller detection that handles most Steam Deck scenarios automatically:

**Automatic Features:**
- **Steam Virtual Controller Detection:** Identifies and properly counts Steam's virtual gamepad devices
- **Physical Controller Filtering:** Uses uhid-based detection to distinguish real controllers from virtual duplicates
- **Steam Input Duplicate Handling:** Automatically adjusts controller count when Steam is running to avoid double-counting
- **Steam Deck Built-in Controls:** Recognizes when the Steam Deck's controls are the only input available (counts as 1 player)
- **Keyboard/Mouse Fallback:** When no controllers are detected, offers to launch in keyboard/mouse mode

**When No Controllers Detected:**

The launcher will prompt with three options:
1. Launch with keyboard/mouse (1 player)
2. Wait for controller connection
3. Exit

**When You May Still Need the Auto-Disable Tool:**

If you want to use the Steam Deck's built-in controls as Player 1 AND connect external controllers for additional players simultaneously, you may need [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller) to prevent input conflicts.

## Usage
- Launch the game from Steam, your desktop menu, or the generated desktop shortcut.
- The script will detect controllers and launch the correct number of Minecraft instances.
- On Steam Deck Game Mode, it will use a nested KDE session for best compatibility.
- **Steam Deck users:** The launcher automatically detects Steam's virtual controllers and handles them correctly. If no controllers are detected, you'll be offered the option to play with keyboard/mouse or wait for a controller connection.

## Installation Locations

**AppImage installations:**
- **Primary installation:** `~/.local/share/ElyPrismLauncher/` (instances, launcher, and game files)
- **Launcher script:** `~/.local/share/ElyPrismLauncher/minecraftSplitscreen.sh` (auto-generated)

**Flatpak installations:**
- **Primary installation:** `~/.var/app/io.github.ElyPrismLauncher.ElyPrismLauncher/data/ElyPrismLauncher/`
- **Launcher script:** `~/.var/app/io.github.ElyPrismLauncher.ElyPrismLauncher/data/ElyPrismLauncher/minecraftSplitscreen.sh` (auto-generated)

**Note:** The launcher script is automatically generated during installation with the correct paths for your system. It includes version metadata for troubleshooting.

- **Temporary files:** Automatically cleaned up after successful installation

## Troubleshooting
- **Java installation issues:**
  - The installer automatically handles Java installation, but if issues occur:
  - Ensure you have an internet connection for downloading Java
  - For manual installation, the installer will provide specific instructions for your system
  - Steam Deck users can use the [install-jdk-on-steam-deck](https://github.com/FlyingEwok/install-jdk-on-steam-deck) script separately if needed
- **Controller issues:**
  - Make sure controllers are connected before launching.

## Updating

### Launcher Updates
To update the launcher script, simply re-run the installer. The script will be regenerated with the latest version and your existing settings will be preserved.

### Minecraft Version Updates
To update your Minecraft version or mod configuration, re-run the installer:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooseprjkt/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/install-minecraft-splitscreen.sh | bash
```
Select your new Minecraft version when prompted. The installer will:
   - Preserve your existing options.txt settings (keybindings, video settings, etc.)
   - Clear old mods and install fresh ones for the new version
   - Update the Fabric loader and all dependencies
   - Keep your existing player profiles and accounts
   - Preserve all your existing worlds

## Uninstall

### Automatic Cleanup (Recommended)

Use the cleanup script to remove all installed components:

```bash
# Download and run the cleanup script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooseprjkt/MinecraftSplitscreenSteamdeck/main/cleanup-minecraft-splitscreen.sh -o cleanup.sh
chmod +x cleanup.sh

# Preview what will be removed (dry-run mode)
./cleanup.sh --dry-run

# Run the cleanup (preserves Java installations by default)
./cleanup.sh

# To also remove Java installations
./cleanup.sh --remove-java
```

The cleanup script removes:
- ElyPrismLauncher data directories (AppImage and Flatpak)
- ElyPrismLauncher Flatpak application
- Desktop shortcuts and app menu entries
- Installer logs

**Note:** Steam shortcuts must be removed manually: Steam > Library > Right-click 'Minecraft Splitscreen' > Manage > Remove non-Steam game

### Manual Uninstall

If you prefer manual removal:
- **AppImage installations:** Delete the ElyPrismLauncher folder: `rm -rf ~/.local/share/ElyPrismLauncher`
- **Flatpak installations:** Delete the ElyPrismLauncher data: `rm -rf ~/.var/app/io.github.ElyPrismLauncher.ElyPrismLauncher/data/ElyPrismLauncher`
- Remove any desktop or Steam shortcuts you created.

## TODO
- ✅ ~~**Steam Deck controller handling**~~ - Basic handling is now implemented: detects virtual controllers, supports keyboard/mouse fallback, handles Steam Deck without external controllers. See [Steam Deck Controller Handling](#steam-deck-controller-handling).
- **Steam Deck + external controllers simultaneously** - Remaining challenge: allowing the Steam Deck's built-in controls to count as Player 1 while external controllers count as additional players (e.g., Steam Deck = P1, external controller = P2). Currently requires [Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller) for this use case.
- **Figure out preconfiguring controllers within controllable (if possible)** - Investigate automatic controller assignment configuration to avoid having Controllable grab the same controllers as all the other instances, ensuring each player gets their own dedicated controller
